                        Boracay Island in the Philippines has been called the Ibiza of Asia, a honeymooner’s dream and a backpacker’s secret, but as the number of visitors increased, so too did the environmental issues. In an attempt to save the island’s ecosystem from ruin, in 2018 the island was closed for six months. Culture Trip speaks to locals about the effect the shutdown had.

                              to modernize living, It was remarkably beautiful way back 2007 to 2012. The transition from 2013 began rapidly and the industries in the town rose. As a citizen of El Nido, all Isay was that you will never be completed your experience in the Philippines if you have not gone to El Nido.
