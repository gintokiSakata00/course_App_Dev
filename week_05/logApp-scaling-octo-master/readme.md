## Author
Gillbert Padon as the author , this is a readme not for instructing you the step by step process of making this project. I want to teach you lesson that I have learn from coding. "Errors wont tell you the step of solving the problem, instead it tells you the problems and where the problems is. It is a joke, the errors tells you that there is an error although we know that errors itself appears because literally an error occur".
My point is that I tell you want you need to know but do not be lazy in learning do your shit also. Do not be lazy in learning, be lazy in CODING.
