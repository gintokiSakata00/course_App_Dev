In this course I am exciting to learn git and most of the basic cli commands. 
My target in this course is to know tools which I need for my career.

Goal 
: 100 wpm qwerty keyboard 
	- this may sound funny but being fast in typing improves productivity
  this will make us do the task more fun and being keyboard independent

: make use of cli commands
	- using batch script is a must but it really sucks but it is useful when handling
  directorys and files. Make use of git for collaboration and do file, link  and etc save on git hub
  for better access globally.

: basic of web dev
	- although app deb focuses more generally in web, the learnings from basic web is a must
  especially in my career. The backend is a must for me since I am planning to do database administrator

with Ma'am Kristine, I am hoping to achieve these goal with self learning as well. I hope to have activities
that will help me establish foundation.
