       <p>HOW IT SPREADS <br><br>
        The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
       <br><br> You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.</p>
        <br>
        COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.
