                        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

            <p>HOW IT SPREADS <br><br>
                The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
            <br><br> You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.</p>
                <br>
                COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.
